# visualize-nyc
This is a Django-Flask app that powers a data science/visualization "blog" @ visualize.nyc. The site is hosted at PythonAnywhere, and uses the SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with a MySQL backend. Each post intends to be a creative insight into some New York City dataset, by way of an interactive D3.js visualization. 

The website will be password protected until I complete my first post - "Around the globe aboard the A-train: a culinary quest through New York City"!

This site is both a passion project and a STEEP learning exercise. I'm excited to get it rolling.
